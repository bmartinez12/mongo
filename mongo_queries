1.	You want price multiplied by quantity to get the value of the product. This is not possible with what we know or in find. 

2.	No collections had to be joined, it was all in one document. The categories are repeated in each product.
db.product.find({}).pretty();

3. db.product.find({}, {name: 1, category: 1}).pretty();

4.	It does produce redundancy. 
db.product.find({}, {name: 1, category: 1, company: 1});
  
5.	Three documents had to be updated.
   db.product.update(
   {company: "Stanley"},
  { $set: {company: "Stanley Black and Decker"} }, 
  { multi:true}
);

6.	No problems!
db.product.find({
  price :
    {$gt: 10.00}
    });
    
db.product.find({
  company : "Stanley Black and Decker"
    });
    
7.    db.product.update(
   {company: "Crest"},
  { $unset: {company: ""} }, 
  { multi:true}
);
